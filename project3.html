                    <p> In the empathize phase of the design process I did an interview, 
                        a observation and a method to find out the thoughts and feelings. 
                        I used an ethnographic interview, a touchstone tours and diary studies
                        combined with photo studies. The result was this empathy map about the user. </p>

                <p> Then I made a user portrait about the user where you can see the bottom here. I also
                    made a design vision together with my partner for the project where we talked
                    about the different engagement and meaning factors which were activation and
                    competence. We also described that she will get a two weeks trip to Japan
                    from her mother with an engaging unwrapping which includes her friends.

                    <p> Then as a team we formulated How Might We questions which fit to
                        the user and the design vision. These were used to ideate and iterate
                        the ideas to get as many ideas as possible including some sketches. 
                        In total I had more than 30 different ideas.

                    developed with Adobe XD. I made low fidelity versions and high
                    fidelity versions before this prototype and it was also tested 
                    with different users including the user the project was designed for.

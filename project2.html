                    <p> At the beginning we had to design the icons for the webpage.
                        Our customer had three different aspects and we designed the icons
                        in the color scheme she liked. As a group we searched for the color
                        schemes and our customer made the choice. We designed the icons then 
                        with Illustrator.

                <p> We had to use Wordpress but we still coded something. We used a theme called Audiotheme 
                    because the calendar was included. Our customer is not keen with technology and 
                    therefore wanted to have an option to change the dates without it being too technical. 
                    The calendar was my role in the 
                    team and I designed and more importantly coded it.

                    <p> Furthermore, it was important to code how the description from 
                        each event looks inside and that's what I did here. I created
                        a Google Maps API, so that Google Maps can be used.  The icons 
                        were also used to get to the page about the specific area.

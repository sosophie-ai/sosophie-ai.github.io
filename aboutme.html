        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> Hello, I'm Sophie and I did a bachelors degree in media technology in St. Pölten (Austria) and studied user 
            experience design for one semester in The Hague (The Netherlands). Next to studying, I worked as a 
            technical assistant at the Campus und City Radio 94.4 in St.Pölten. </p>

        <p> I want to work in web development, at a radio station or as user experience designer. As I have gained skills 
            in each of these fields, I can develop my skills further in each of this directions. In concrete, I have skills in 
            HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, Java, Adobe Creative Cloud and skills at a radio station + UX design . </p>

        <p> My inspiration comes from my daily life and other people. Design is About being exact for me and I care a
            lot about details. I am punctual and always manage to organize my work well which I learned from working
            next to studying. I am a team player but also enjoy to work alone sometimes - the mixture works for me!</p>
